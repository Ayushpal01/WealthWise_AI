**WealthWise AI** is a powerful, multi-page dashboard built with Streamlit and powered by Google's Gemini AI. It helps users plan, track, and achieve their financial goals by combining traditional financial forecasting with personalized, AI-generated strategies.

This project was developed for the "Gen AI for Business" course at IIM Mumbai.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Goal Planner:** Set long-term financial goals (like retirement or a down payment), input your investment plan, and visualize your projected wealth growth with an interactive Plotly chart.
* **AI-Powered Strategy:** Receive personalized insights and actionable advice on your financial plan. The AI analyzes your trajectory and suggests improvements to your budgeting, investment strategy, and risk management.
* **Context-Aware AI Advisor:** Chat with an AI that understands your financial plan. Ask specific questions about your goals or general finance topics and get tailored answers.
